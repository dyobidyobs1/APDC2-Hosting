        <p align="left"><b>EXTRACTION</b></p>
        <p align="left">A dental extraction is the removal of badly carious teeth from the dental alveolus (socket) in the alveolar bone.

        <p align="left"><b>WISDOM TOOTH REMOVAL</b></p>
        <p align="left">If the wisdom teeth are impacted and embedded in the bone, the oral surgeon will put an incision into the gums and remove the tooth or teeth in sections in order to minimize the amount of bone being removed.

        <p align="left"><b>BONE AUDMENTATION PROCEDURE</b></p>
        <p align="left">For dental implants to take hold successfully, your jaw needs to have healthy bone to support them and hold them securely into the jawbone. If you've previously experienced oral conditions, such as gum or periodontal disease, injury or trauma to your face and jaw, the quality of your bone may be compromised. Patients who have had teeth extracted and left the spaces empty or have worn dentures for many years could also find their bone density level insufficient to support dental implants.
            
        <p align="left"><b>GINGIVOPLASTY</b></p>
        <p align="left">Gingivoplasty is the surgical reshaping of gum tissue around the teeth. It is often is done simply to make gums look better.

        <p align="left"><b>LABIAL FRENECTOMY</b></p>
        <p align="left">A labial frenectomy is a form of frenectomy performed on the lip. The labial frenulum often attaches to the center of the upper lip and between the upper two front teeth. Orthodontic patients often have this procedure done to assist with closing a front tooth gap.

            
        <p align="left"><b>ALVEOLECTOMY</b></p>
        <p align="left">Alveolectomy refers to removal of some or all alveolar bone surrounding a tooth. A dental operation to smooth off irregular bone on the edges of tooth sockets so that a better fitmay be obtained for dentures. Periodontal surgery
            
        <p align="left"><b>PERIODONTAL SURGERY</b></p>
        <p align="left">Is a plastic (reshaping) surgical procedure designed to restore and regenerate normal form and function to lost and damaged periodontal structures which support the teeth (the gum tissue, periodontal ligament and bone). 
            
        <p align="left"><b>LIP REPOSITIONING</b></p>
        <p align="left">The lip repositioning procedure is a simple surgical technique designed to restrict high movement of the upper lip. During this procedure, the dentist will remove a strip of tissue from the inner portion of the top lip. The newly exposed area is then sutured into a lower, more aesthetically desirable position.

        <p align="left"><b>WHAT ARE DENTAL IMPLANTS?</b></p>
        <p align="left">A dental implant is a small post, usually made of titanium, that serves as a substitute for the root of the tooth. A connector, known as an abutment, is placed on, or built into, the top of the dental implant, which connects it to the replacement tooth. Finally, a crown, a replacement tooth, is custom fabricated to match your natural teeth, completing the dental implant.

    <div class="content3" style="max-width:100%">
    <div class="text">
        <p align="left"><b>WHO IS A GOOD CANDIDATE FOR DENTAL IMPLANTS?</b></p>
        <p align="left">Almost anyone who is missing a single tooth, multiple teeth, or all teeth are candidates for dental implants. You must have a strong, healthy jawbone and gums in order for dental implants to be a viable tooth replacement option for you. If you have experienced bone loss due to a tooth abscess, or suffer from oral health problems such as gingivitis, dental implants may not be for you.

    <div class="content3" style="max-width:100%">
    <div class="text">
        <p align="left"><b>HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO REPLACE TEETH USING DENTAL IMPLANTS?</b></p>
        <p align="left">Each patient is different. After completing the necessary diagnostics, your implant dentist should provide you with a treatment plan including the estimated amount of time to complete the process. Total treatment time depends on your needs, medical and dental history, the health of the supporting bone in yourjaw, and the technique and materials that will be used. It can be as short as a few months, or more than a year for more complex conditions.

    <div class="text">
        <p align="left"><b>DOES IT HURT TO GET DENTAL IMPLANTS? </b></p>
        <p align="left">Humans are "blessed" with 2 sets of teeth (baby teeth and adult/permanent teeth). When a single permanent tooth or multiple teeth are lost due to dental decay or gum disease, dental implants can now replace them as the 3rd set of fixed teeth! Dental implants can last a lifetime and can improve your appearance, your confidence, and your ability to eat the foods you like, and participate in an active lifestyle, without worrying about your teeth. Dental implants are made of titanium and can never get dental decay!

    <div class="content3" style="max-width:100%">
    <div class="text">
        <p align="left"><b>WHAT ARE THE DISADVANTAGES OF DENTAL IMPLANTS ?</b></p>
        <p align="left">Like any minor oral surgical procedure, there is a risk of infection, inflammation, and pain, but your oral surgeon will discuss how these can be managed for your specific situation. If there is no available bone to place the implant, then bone and gum grafting procedures may be required.
